h1. daycount-0.1.2.js

Well, this makes it two releases in one day - quite a pace, though probably not abnormal so early in a project.  Development will probably slow down soon as the basic features are nearly all implemented.

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* @mars@ has an improved @toString()@ that includes more detailed information.

Added support for counts:

* *Long Count* (@daycount.counts.long@)

The following counts can now be recognized in text:

* Gregorian e.g. *2012-12-21*
* Local Julian Day e.g. *LJD:2456283*
* Long Count e.g. *13.0.0.0.0*

A new demo, *explorer*, has been added, or rather copied from it's previous home outside of this project.
