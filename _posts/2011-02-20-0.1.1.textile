h1. daycount-0.1.1.js

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* @mercury@ has been renamed to @mars@, since it was named incorrectly in code.
* @daycount.counts.gregorian@ has an improved @toString()@ that zero-pads month and day numbers to keep them two characters long.

Added support for counts:

* *Thoth Count* (@daycount.counts.thoth@)

Coming soon:

* Recognize date strings and parse them into corresponding counts.
