h1. daycount-0.1.3.js

Ok, one more release before I go to sleep.

Known bugs:

* Safari 5 still doesn't work with the *explorer* demo.

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* @increment()@ has been renamed to @plus()@, returning a new moment instead of modifying the given moment.

The following counts can now also be recognized in text:

* Venus e.g. *VC:11/86*
* Mars e.g. *MC:4/533*
* Thoth e.g. *TC:38/35*

Also, the *explorer* demo has been vastly improved with a few small changes.
